    """
    This function compiles a multi-gpu version of your model. This is done using data
    parallelism, by making N copies of the model on the different GPUs, all of which
    share parameters. Gradients are updated synchronously, using the average gradient
    from all of the outputs of the various models. This effectively allows you to scale
    a model up to batch_sizes which cannot fit on a single GPU.

    This method returns a "primary" copy of the model, which has had its training
    function which is run by Keras overridden to be a training function which trains
    all of the towers of the model. The other towers never have their training functions
    initialised or used and are completely hidden from the user. The returned model
    can be serialised in the same way as any other model and has no dependency on
    multiple gpus being available when it is loaded.

    Note that by calling this function, the model_builder function will be called multiple times
    for the different GPUs. As such, you should be wary of this function having side
    effects unrelated to building a computation graph.

    Parameters
    ----------

    model_builder: Callable[any, DeepQaModel], required.
        A function which returns an uncompiled DeepQaModel.
    compile_arguments: Params, required
        Model parameters which are passed to compile. These should be the same as if you
        were building a single GPU model, with the exception of the ``num_gpus`` field.

    Returns
    -------
    The "primary" copy of the DeepQaModel, which holds the training function which
    trains all of the copies of the model.
